# Car Assistant
  This project shows a very basic application that uses voice recogition.
  
  After seeing a tutorial on 'http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/make-your-next-android-app-a-good-listener/' ,
  I decided to modify and make and applicaiton that is very basic and can be used while driving.
  
  This application has a very small grammar but it can be added and improved.
  
# How to install

  My advice to get started is just clone this and import this project in your android studio
  
  If you really are looking to learn then i would suggest you to go thorugh the code and try to understand it and add new features to it.
